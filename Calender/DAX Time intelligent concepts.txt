##DAX Time intelligent concepts 

### 1. Sales from Previous Month
To calculate sales from the previous month, you can use the `DATEADD` function. This function shifts the dates in the current context by the specified number of intervals.

**DAX Code:**
```DAX
PreviousMonthSales = CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
    DATEADD(Calendar[Date], -1, MONTH)
)
```

**Summary of Logic:**
- **SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]):** This part of the formula sums up the sales amount from the Sales table.
- **DATEADD(Calendar[Date], -1, MONTH):** This shifts the current date context by -1 month. So if the current context is May 2023, it shifts to April 2023.
- **CALCULATE:** This function changes the context in which the data is evaluated, applying the date shift from `DATEADD`.

### 2. Sales from the Same Period Last Year
To calculate sales from the same period in the previous year, you can use the `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` function. This function returns a table that is shifted back one year.

**DAX Code:**
```DAX
PreviousYearSales = CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Calendar[Date])
)
```

**Summary of Logic:**
- **SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]):** Sums up the sales amount from the Sales table.
- **SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Calendar[Date]):** This shifts the date context back by one year. So if the current context is May 2023, it shifts to May 2022.
- **CALCULATE:** Changes the context to apply the year shift and then sums the sales for that new context.

### 3. Year-to-Date Sales
To calculate the year-to-date (YTD) sales, you can use the `TOTALYTD` function. This function returns the sum of an expression evaluated for the dates in the year up to the specified date.

**DAX Code:**
```DAX
YTDsales = TOTALYTD(
    SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
    Calendar[Date]
)
```

**Summary of Logic:**
- **SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]):** Sums up the sales amount from the Sales table.
- **TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Calendar[Date]):** Calculates the sum of sales from the start of the year to the current date context.

### 4. Quarter-to-Date Sales
To calculate the quarter-to-date (QTD) sales, you can use the `TOTALQTD` function.

**DAX Code:**
```DAX
QTDsales = TOTALQTD(
    SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
    Calendar[Date]
)
```

**Summary of Logic:**
- **SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]):** Sums up the sales amount from the Sales table.
- **TOTALQTD(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Calendar[Date]):** Calculates the sum of sales from the start of the quarter to the current date context.

### 5. Month-to-Date Sales
To calculate the month-to-date (MTD) sales, you can use the `TOTALMTD` function.

**DAX Code:**
```DAX
MTDsales = TOTALMTD(
    SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
    Calendar[Date]
)
```

**Summary of Logic:**
- **SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]):** Sums up the sales amount from the Sales table.
- **TOTALMTD(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Calendar[Date]):** Calculates the sum of sales from the start of the month to the current date context.

### Cheat Sheet Summary
- **Previous Month Sales:** Uses `DATEADD` to shift dates by -1 month.
  ```DAX
  PreviousMonthSales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), DATEADD(Calendar[Date], -1, MONTH))
  ```
- **Previous Year Sales:** Uses `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` to shift dates by -1 year.
  ```DAX
  PreviousYearSales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Calendar[Date]))
  ```
- **Year-to-Date Sales:** Uses `TOTALYTD` to calculate sales from the start of the year.
  ```DAX
  YTDsales = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Calendar[Date])
  ```
- **Quarter-to-Date Sales:** Uses `TOTALQTD` to calculate sales from the start of the quarter.
  ```DAX
  QTDsales = TOTALQTD(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Calendar[Date])
  ```
- **Month-to-Date Sales:** Uses `TOTALMTD` to calculate sales from the start of the month.
  ```DAX
  MTDsales = TOTALMTD(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), Calendar[Date])
  ```
